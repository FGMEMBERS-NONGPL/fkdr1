FlightGear Fokker Dr.1 Triplane
====================================
This directory contains two variants of the Fokker Dr.1 Triplane:

1. JSBSim based FDM which incorporates much of the UIUC data.
   call: fgfs --aircraft=fkdr1

2. UIUC based FDM
   call: fgfs --aircraft=fkdr1-v1-nl-uiuc


Both versions share the same 3d model and sounds.

The " Throttles" for the DrI
====================================
From: http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?t=478020

On the Left side of the cockpit :- There is the rod with a little loop on the
end ....This is the connection to the fuel tank Fuel Tap , and is open / closed
(Aft position ) .

Also in this place , is a toothed " Quadrant " and a lever with a long wooden
handle .
This is connected to a rod , which operates the " Fine Adjustement Control
Valve " , for fuel flowing from the petrol tank Tap , to the main jet on the
Bloctube Carburettor , ( As would the "Tampier" control on the N17) , in order
to optimise the mixture to compensate for changes in altitude .(Low hight
requires more fuel to air ,where the air is more dense ....High Altitude ,
thinner air , needs less fuel .) .


On the Control Column .:- Here is the "Blip switch " , for use at low engine
speed ,when the throttle is closed , such as in landing & taxing, or as needed
in combat .

Also on the control column ...The Left Hand Grip is a Bowden lever , and this
operates directly , via 2 Bowden cables , the sprung loaded lever of the
Air-Slide (and fuel Needlevalve/main jet ) of the Bloctube Carburettor .....
This can be called the Main throttle .


On the Right side of the cockpit ,:-..Should either of the above mentioned
Bowden cables break , then the Air slide lever is sprung loaded to open fully .
This is the fail safe ) .
In order to offer some "Throttle " control ,.... There is , on the right side ,
a " T " handle and rod , which connects through a bellcrank to a sliding joint
rod , to the Bloctube throttle slide lever ....This may be used in order to
"Close" the throttle by any amount , as required .
( This T handle is often mistakenly thought to operate the Oil Tap )
